<p style="text-align:justify">The eCIR exam is fully hands-on and focuses on realistic incident scenarios that require in-depth analysis and investigation. Through the exam process, I strengthened my skills in key areas, including:

🔍 Threat Detection & SIEM Operations – Analyzing logs and correlating data to identify suspicious activity.
🖥 Endpoint & Network Analysis – Investigating endpoint behavior, privilege escalation techniques, and network traffic.
🧬 Digital Forensics – Examining binaries, registry artifacts, and forensic evidence.
🧠 Threat Intelligence – Mapping attacker behavior to known TTPs.
📝 Reporting & Communication – Creating clear incident reports with timelines and remediation steps.</p>
