<p style="text-align:justify">Certified Threat Hunting and Incident Response I (CTHRI-I) validates your ability to investigate real-world security incidents end-to-end. This practical exam focuses on hypothesis-driven hunting, log analysis, endpoint telemetry triage, network signal interpretation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and clear, actionable reporting. Candidates work through interactive, time-boxed scenarios that simulate enterprise conditions—pivoting across host and network data, correlating events, and documenting containment, eradication and recovery.</p>
