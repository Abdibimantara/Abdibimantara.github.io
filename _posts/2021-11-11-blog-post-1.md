Hi everyone,
I’m currently going to try to finish the Capture The Flag (CTF) lab. This lab is titled Simple CTF (Try Hackme).

In this case, there are 10 lists of questions that we must solve. Our goal is only one, namely Flag ^-^…

<p>1. How many services are running under port 1000? To solve this problem, we can use Nmap tools.</p>

<p>answer : 2 service (ftp and http) </p>

<p>2. What is running on the higher port?</p>
<p>answer : ssh </p>

<p>3. What’s the CVE you’re using against the application ? To solve this problem, we can use Gobuster tools.</p>

<p>The results of the gobuster tools show that /sample makes us interested in entering. </p>

<p>At first glance, this website is quite normal. but after researching in detail. There is a gap for us to find out more. The information we get, the website uses the CMSmade simple utility. and bingo. There is an exploit for this mad Simple CMS.</p>
