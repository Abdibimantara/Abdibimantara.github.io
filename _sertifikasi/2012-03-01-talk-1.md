<p style="text-align:justify">A Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) is a person trained to penetrate their own computer system or that of a client in order to determine what vulnerabilities exist and how to apply protective, corrective, and preventive countermeasures. This helps to mitigate risk and protect the system from being compromised by an unethical hacker or cybercriminal. The CEH is trained to look for weaknesses that can be exploited using the same tools a hacker would use to attack. Their job may include making recommendations for how to patch vulnerabilities or creating strategies to prevent malicious attacks.</p>
